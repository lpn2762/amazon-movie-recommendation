    "I changed the sampling methodology a bit. It turns out we can't just filter movies and users just once because when we remove users, that changes the number of reviews per movie, and vice versa. So, we have to iteratetively filter to convergence. I initially wrote make_sample for spark dataframes, but it turns out that running this locally is quite slow, so I wrote an identical implementation for pandas, which was lightning fast! So for data sampling, I just did everything in pandas but left the spark code here anyways."

    "# Creating samples\n",
    "The problem with using smaller samples of data while maintaining the density of the original data is simply that the original data is too sparse. This puts a lower bound on how small we can make our sampled data, so a solution was to make the original dataset more dense (i.e. require that each movie has at least $k$ reviews and each user made at least $k$ reviews for $k \\geq 5$). In the make_sample function, I call $k$ the threshold. Basically, if we decide first what proportion of the data we want to sample, we can then adjust the threshold to control the density of the sample. The parameters I choose and the resulting densities were:\n",
